## GoDo API was built to support the GoDo application, in providing a RESTful API.

# Getting Started

## Docker

Quickly get started by using Docker to install the GoDo API.

```sh
docker-compose up -d db
docker-compose up --build -d server
```

## Requirements

- Go (to compile applications)
- PostgreSQL

To do this, all you need is to have Go - [the programming language](https://golang.org/doc/install) - installed on your computer.

To edit the necessary variables to hook up GoDo API with a database. You will need to clone the GoDo API repository.

```sh
$ git clone github.com/rsHalford/godo-api
```

Then after making the [necessary changes](#setting-up) to the source code. Build the GoDo API binary, for the operating server it will be ran on.

```sh
$ env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build github.com/rsHalford/godo-api
```

> This example command will build GoDo API to be executable on Debian 10.

Then you would need to have a web server installed and a way to run GoDo API as a daemon.

- Apache2 (ProxyPass to your web address)
- Systemd (daemonize GoDo API to run in the background)

> These recommendations are based on what I found to work best for my setup.

## Setting Up

To setup the server application, there a three changes that need to be made.

### Authentication

To secure your todo list online, you will need to change the `api_username` and `api_password` variables, required to access the API endpoints. These variables are found in the `config.yaml` file.

These values will be what you send to the API with each request, using Basic Authentication.

> An example of the `config.yaml` can be found in the [project's repository](https://github.com/rsHalford/godo-api/blob/main/config.yaml)

```yaml
api_username: "username"
api_password: "password"
```

Currently GoDo API only supports PostgreSQL. To link up the server to a database, make sure to edit the `config.yaml`. Providing the `db_username`, `db_password`, `name` and `port` - relating to your database address.

```yaml
db_username: "username"
db_password: "password"
name: "godo api"
port: "5432"
```

### Server

GoDo API by default serves on port `:8080`. As an example, below is a basic Apache configuration file to relay GoDo API to your domain.

Apache Configuration Example:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName godo.example.com
        ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com
        ProxyRequests Off
        <Proxy *>
                Require all granted
        </Proxy>
        ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
        ProxyPassReverse / http:127.0.0.1:8080/
        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/godo-api-error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/godo-api-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

### Daemonize

To have GoDo API run at all times in the background. You will need to make it run as a daemon. This is possible by creating one as a service with your init system - such as with systemd.

Systemd Service Example:

```toml
[Unit]
Description=GoDo API RESTful API

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/godo-api/excutable
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/godo-api
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=inherit
SyslogIdentifier=godo-api
User=user
Group=group
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
