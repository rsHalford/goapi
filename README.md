# About

GoAPI was built to support the GoDo application, in providing a RESTful API.

# Getting Started

To setup the server, make sure to edit the `dsn` variable to match the user, password and table of your postgres database. This is found in the model/model.go file.

Then change the username and password, required to access the API endpoints. These variables are found at the top of the main.go file.
